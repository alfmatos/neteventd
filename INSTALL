Build and Installation Instructions:
====================================

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

Build from git
==============

  Requires autoconf >= 2.59, automake >= 1.9, aclocal >= 1.9

  Ajust the automake and aclocal version in ./autogen.sh if you do not have 
automake >= 1.9 as the default. The same goes for aclocal.

  Run:

  $ ./autogen.sh

  And proceed with the normal build and install instructions.
